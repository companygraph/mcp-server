<!-- conventions · v1.45.0 -->
Shared conventions of the robertblust, guestgraph and companygraph organizations live in `conventions/`, vendored from robertblust/conventions at the release `conventions.json` names. Read them before writing or committing anything here.

- `conventions/WRITING.md` — how we write: one voice, three registers, English and German.
- `conventions/WORKING.md` — how we work with git and GitHub.
- `conventions/REPOSITORIES.md` — the family: what each repository is and what pins what.
- `conventions/PINS.md` — what a member pins and how the family resync moves it.
- `conventions/WRITER.md`, `conventions/TRANSLATOR.md`, `conventions/EDITOR.md`,
  `conventions/BACKREADER.md`, `conventions/GLOSSARY.md`, `conventions/GERMAN.md` — the four roles
  that make a text, the terms they keep and the German they write.

Everything below this block is this repository's own. `sh conventions/conventions-sync check` says whether the copy matches the release, `sync` brings it to the release the pin names, and `sh conventions/conventions-check` holds this repository's own Markdown to `WRITING.md`, and `sh conventions/conventions-format` to its one form, which `fix` writes. Edit a shared file in robertblust/conventions, never here.

A change to a tool's arguments or answer is a change to `lib/schemas.mjs`, to `docs/INTERFACE.md` and, where it breaks, to the release notes' `Interface` section, in the same pull request. `npm run interface` rewrites the document's examples after any change to an answer or to the pinned meta-model's worked example.

The JavaScript in `lib/`, `bin/` and `deploy/` is the source and what runs, and its types are JSDoc in the same files. A TypeScript consumer reads the declarations `npm run build` writes from that JSDoc into `types/`, and they are committed, because a consumer takes the package from a tag and builds nothing. So a change to a type is made in the JSDoc, built, and committed with what the build wrote, and a file in `types/` is never edited by hand; `npm run build:check`, which the `test` job runs before its suite, writes the declarations into a temporary folder and fails on one in `types/` that differs or that no module writes, and `npm run typecheck` is the compiler's verdict on the JSDoc alone. The JavaScript itself does not change for a type: a JSDoc cast adds parentheses and nothing else, and a declaration that cannot be said without changing the code is a reason to ask first. `test/portability.test.mjs` reads `lib/` and `bin/` as text, comments included, so a type's name is never one an entity of the worked example or of the reference instance carries. TypeScript and Node's types are devDependencies and nothing else is. Why the types are JSDoc rather than TypeScript source is in meta-model's `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-30-types-from-jsdoc-design.md`.
