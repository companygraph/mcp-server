<!-- conventions · v1.31.0 -->
Shared conventions of the robertblust, guestgraph and companygraph organizations live in `conventions/`, vendored from robertblust/conventions at the release `conventions.json` names. Read them before writing or committing anything here.

- `conventions/WRITING.md` — how we write: one voice, three registers, English and German.
- `conventions/WORKING.md` — how we work with git and GitHub.
- `conventions/REPOSITORIES.md` — the family: what each repository is and what pins what.
- `conventions/WRITER.md`, `conventions/TRANSLATOR.md`, `conventions/EDITOR.md`,
  `conventions/BACKREADER.md`, `conventions/GLOSSARY.md`, `conventions/GERMAN.md` — the four roles
  that make a text, the terms they keep and the German they write.

Everything below this block is this repository's own. `sh conventions/conventions-sync check` says whether the copy matches the release, `sync` brings it to the release the pin names, and `sh conventions/conventions-check` holds this repository's own Markdown to `WRITING.md`, and `sh conventions/conventions-format` to its one form, which `fix` writes. Edit a shared file in robertblust/conventions, never here.

A change to a tool's arguments or answer is a change to `lib/schemas.mjs`, to `docs/INTERFACE.md` and, where it breaks, to the release notes' `Interface` section, in the same pull request. `npm run interface` rewrites the document's examples after any change to an answer or to the pinned meta-model's worked example.
